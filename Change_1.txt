Change 1

*Remark 1 is accepted. Variable name "then" changed to "one_week_ago"

*Remark 2 is not accepted. The problem is monkeypatch. When checking, it replaces EURO_RATE and USD_RATE, but the old values remain in the dictionary, therefore the test fails. (I could be wrong)

*Remark 3 - partially accepted. Value & unit variable names changed.

*Remark 4 is accepted. Made adjustments

*Remark 5 is accepted. Made adjustments
